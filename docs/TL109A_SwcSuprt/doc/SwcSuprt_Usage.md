# Introduction

SwcSuprt is a component support script for EA4 component development. It
automates many redundant tasks, and is useful to easily update a
component to the latest standards.

Both GUI and command-line interfaces are supported. If this script is
run with both a path to a component and a command, the script continues
running in the command line. Otherwise, the GUI is initialized.

## Dependencies

This tool requires the TL112A_Python component. This component contains
the Nexteer Python library nxtr.py, which is required by this tool (a
vanilla Python environment will not contain this library).

# Running the Tool

## Launch.bat

In the tools directory, running Launch.bat will load the tool directly
with no arguments. The tool prompts the user with the main menu, which
can be used to create a new component or select an existing component.
Once this is done, the user is prompted with the component menu.

## SWCSupport.bat

Once the tool is integrated with a component, it can be launched with
SWCSupport.bat, located in the component’s tools directory. This will
immediately launch the component menu.

## Command Line Usage

The expected command line format is as follows:

swcsuprt.py \["/path/to/component" \[command\]\]

If no arguments are provided, the tool will present the main menu. If
run with a single argument, the tool will open the component menu for
the component at the path provided. The path may be relative or
absolute.

If run with two arguments, the tool will run in a non-interactive
command line format. command may be one of the following:

-   initialize – create basic directories if they don't already exist

-   migrate – perform component migration to latest directory format.
    Also runs:

    -   generate_greenhills

    -   generate_davinci

    -   generate_integration_files

    -   generate_generation_script

-   generate_greenhills – generate Green Hills project file

-   generate_davinci – generate DaVinci component files

-   generate_integration_files – generate integration files

-   generate_generation_script – generate generation batch script, or
    remove it if not necessary

-   generate_sandbox – generate sandbox project

-   generate_local_headers – generate local header files from
    Configurator

-   generate_polyspace_files – generate Polyspace project files and
    stubs

-   unzip_poly space – unzip Polyspace archives

-   open_bugfinder – open Polyspace Bug Finder project

-   open_codeprover – open Polyspace Code Prover project

-   zip_polyspace – zip current Polyspace results into archives

See the description of the functions in the component menu for more
details on each command.

# The Main Menu

style="width:1.66944in;height:2.31319in" />

Click **New Component** to create a folder template for a new component.
The tool will prompt for a full component name and parent directory, and
then present the component menu for the newly created component. The new
component will only contain the basic folder structure, and the
SWCSupport.bat script.

Click **Select Existing** to open the component menu for an existing
component. The tool will prompt for the main component directory. If the
selected directory is missing the standard component subfolders (e.g.
autosar, src, include), the tool will display a warning.

Click **Quit** to close the tool.

# The Component Menu

The main menu contains five sections:

## Component

The component short name is shown here.

If the component appears to be of an older format (e.g. contains a
tools/contract directory), this section will also contain an additional
button. Click **Migrate** to automatically update this component to the
latest format, moving files as needed. Note that this will also run all
commands in the Create/Update section.

## Create/Update

Click **Green Hills** to generate the Green Hills project file (.gpj).

Click **DaVinci** to generate the DaVinci Configurator project files.
This includes the DaVinci Project file (.dpa) and some files in the
tools/local/autosar directory. Note that if a .bswmd.arxml file is added
to the autosar folder, this function must be run in order to include it
in the component configuration.

Click **Integration Files** to generate files for integration. This
feature checks for any .bswmd.arxml files in the autosar directory, then
creates an integration script in the tools/integrate folder. If no
.bswmd.arxml files are found, no integration script is needed and it is
removed.

Click **Generation Script** to generate the batch script used by
Configurator when generating configuration files from ARTT text template
files. This feature checks for any template files (.tt) in the
tools/template directory, and creates a generation script if found.
Otherwise, the generation script is removed.

Click **Sandbox Project** to generate the sandbox project used from the
Green Hills project file. (.gpj). The project file will open as well
even if no update/creation took place. The sandbox is an area used to
test if component level source codes compile. This will also generate
the .d, .dbo, and .o files in a folder called SandboxOutput that is
located on the same level as the components.

## Davinci

Click **Generate** to generate the RTE files, contract header files, and
any configurable files of the component for local compilation testing
and static analysis. If an error occurs, log files may exist in the
tools directory, as well as the tools/local/generate directory.

## Polyspace

Click **Generate Files** to generate all project and related files to
the tools/Polyspace directory. This function checks for all source files
and include directories, adding them to the Polyspace projects. It also
looks for a corresponding design component in the component’s parent
directory. If not automatically found, the user is prompted to locate it
manually or proceed without using a data dictionary. Note that not using
a data dictionary causes many orange errors in Code Prover. It is
recommended to run this function before analysis is performed.

Click **Unzip Results** to decompress any saved results from previous
analyses. Previous results are stored in the tools/Polyspace/Saved
directory.

Click **Open Bug Finder** to open the Bug Finder Polyspace project.

Click **Open Code Prover** to open the Code Prover Polyspace project.

Click **Create Reports** to generate XML reports from the Bug Finder and
Code Prover results. These reports may be used in the future to gather
information at the request of the customer. Currently, they will be
stored in Synergy to prepare for potential use.

Click **Zip Results** to delete backup comment folders and archive the
current results to the tools/Polyspace/Saved directory.

# File and Directory Structure

The following directories exist in every software component:

autosar – contains all Developer/Configurator files

doc – documentation

generate – all generated source and header files (used in the
integration project)

include – component header files

src – component source files

tools – contains the component DaVinci project file, the Green Hills
Project file, and a script to launch the SwcSuprt tool

tools/integrate – all integration-related files

tools/local – all files used in local component development, but not
used at the integration project level. This contains any stubs required
for static analysis, as well as configurator files used to create a
local environment. Each directory in this path resembles the base
directory structure (e.g. autosar, generate, include, src).

tools/Polyspace – Polyspace Bug Finder and Code Prover project files,
along with project-related files. Also contains the archived results
from previous analyses.

tools/template – any files involved in generation from text templates at
both the component and integration project level
