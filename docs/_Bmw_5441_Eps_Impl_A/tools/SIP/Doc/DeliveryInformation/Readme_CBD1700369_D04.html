<p> <b>Note / Integration hints </b></p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>BAC modules </b></p>
<p>In our integration we used the latest BMW BAC modules which were available </p>
<p>(BAC4.3 Version 3.5.0). However, we faced some issues with the BAC modules </p>
<p>which forced us to modify the code of the BAC modules to be able to do a complete </p>
<p>flash process successfully. Both issues were submitted to BMW and we suppose they </p>
<p>get fixed in one of the next BAC4.3 releases. </p>
<p>We added the modified you your SIP in the folder “IntegrationFiles”: </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The patches are marked in the files with @@@patchedByVector. You can replace the </p>
<p>original files with these ones as long as these issues exist. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At BMW the issue are registered as BAC-6612 and BAC-6828. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>DiagSystemTest </b></p>
<p>One testcase (3.1.4) of the DiagSystemTest could not be performed successfully </p>
<p>since the test suite just stops the CANoe measurement when running this testcase. </p>
<p>Please contact BMW in case you’re facing the same issue. </p>
